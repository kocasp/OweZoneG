          First thing you should do after creating an event is adding some participants. You can do it by clicking #{image_tag "add_person_button.jpg"} button on your dashboard. After adding few people take a look on your
          %strong Debts Statistics
          table. Every person will show up with current balance zero. Next thing you can do is to add some

        %br/
        %div
          When you have some people on the list, you can add transactions. Transaction is a purchase of some goods. You can select who pays for them and who should be charged for them in the statistics.
          %br/
          %strong For example:
          %br/
          There are 4 people - James, John, Nathan and Sidney. You've bought some common food.James paid 200 and John paid 100. John is not going to eat it, so he should not be charged for that.
          %br/
          In that situation you should check only James, Nathan and Sidney names. Then type "200" next to James and "100" next to John (because they were the ones who paid).

        %h2 Make some changes when you want.
        %div
          You can add a participant in every moment. When a person comes up and he wants to join your event, you can just add him to the list and check his name in the transactions you already created.
